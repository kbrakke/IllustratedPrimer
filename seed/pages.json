Sapphire added, 'Just like the flowers need different colors to make a rainbow, friends are special because of their differences!' Sunny flew in a happy circle and said, 'And when we help each other, we can do amazing things!' The princess smiled, understanding that true friendship celebrates what makes each person unique.",
