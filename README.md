# Illustrated Primer

This project is a Next.js application that includes a chat interface powered by Langchain and OpenAI.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Color Scheme

The application uses an e-ink friendly color palette:

- Background: #FFFFFF (Pure White)
- Text: #000000 (Pure Black)
- Secondary Background: #F5F5F5 (Off-White)
- Borders/Dividers: #E0E0E0 (Light Gray)

This minimal color scheme ensures optimal readability on e-ink displays while maintaining visual hierarchy through subtle contrast.
